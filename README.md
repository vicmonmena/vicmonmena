Hello! My name is Vicente and I consider myself a programming enthusiast :computer:. I am always learning and trying to promote this culture among the people I relate with (my mother told me every morning before going to school :school: "Learn and enjoy!") :family: I love my family, especially my daughter :girl: and my wife :woman:, who make me want to be a better person every day. Supporter of Betis :soccer:. Tennis fan since I was a child :tennis: (thanks Dad!). Gamer in decline. :video_game: Humour as a philosophy of life!
